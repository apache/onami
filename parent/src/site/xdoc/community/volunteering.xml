    <section name="On Volunteering">
      <p>
        Like, <i>Apache Commons</i> is a little bit different from other Apache projects. It's an assembly of components each with its
        own little community of users, developers and committers. Of course, there is some overlap between components and an
        <em>espirit de corps</em> but Onami is a big, busy Bazaar.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, one FAQ is -
        <em>I'd like to help but how do I volunteer?</em>
        Hopefully people asking this have already browsed through the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html"> general Apache documentation
        </a>
        but are having troubles getting a grip on Commons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily Craig R. McClanahan posted an excellent answer to this very question to the commons-dev list -
        <em>so why not get involved?!</em>

        page says that you need any &gt;contributions. So let me know. &gt; &gt;Prabhat.

      <pre>Hello Prabhat, The best way to contribute is to identify for yourself things that you think are broken, or
        could be improved, and then propose a patch. A couple of ways to identify possible candidates: * Have you used a
        commons API, and wished it would do something a little more? or a little different? In open source circles,
        people often get involved initially by "scratching your own itch" as the saying goes. * Have you called up the
        bug reports &gt;http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/&lt; for the Commons project, and seen any bugs that you
        can create a patch for? * Have you checked your favorite package's TODO or STATUS files for things that have
        already been thought about, but just are not done yet? Craig
