Welcome to JUnice!

  JUnice is a small java library for <JUnit> that minimizes the boilerplate code
  in your unit test relying on <Google Guice> to inject directly into your test
  cases all the required dependecies.
  Moreover it makes easier creating and injecting Mock and Stubs for your test
  cases and inject them into your  bussiness-logic classes.

Before Coding...

  To set up your project, configure in your pom.xml the <<<dependency>>>:

+----------------------------------------+
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.nnsoft.guice.junice</groupId>
        <artifactId>junice</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>

  This work is dedicated to our city, L'Aquila, destroyed by a terrible
  earthquake the 6th April, 2009... That day more than 300 people were killed
  because buildings collapsed after a magnitudo 6.3 earthquake at 3:32 am.

  We'll never forget that episode.
